    <p style="30px">The Spam Email Detector represents an accessible and highly practical beginner AI project, distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM), this project involves training a model on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam. The key is to extract features from the emails, such as specific keywords, frequency of certain words, and email formatting, which the model then learns to associate with spammy content.</p>
    <h2>2. Chatbot for Customer Service</h2>

    <p>A Chatbot for Customer Service project focuses on creating an AI-powered conversational agent that can understand and respond to customer inquiries automatically. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, these chatbots can significantly improve the efficiency and availability of customer service across various industries. This basic AI project can introduce developers to the complexities of language understanding and generation, providing hands-on experience in building systems that can handle customer queries, from simple FAQ responses to more complex transactional conversations</p>
    <h2>3. Face Detection System</h2>
